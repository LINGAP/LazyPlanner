# LazyPlanner
The core idea of Lazy Planner is to help people get control of their daily meals easier. The project was initially designed by Healthy Eating group in COMP494, during which we came up with a digital prototype. Now two of the group members would like to try implement the app, as a mean to both put the initiative into practice and practice development skills.
